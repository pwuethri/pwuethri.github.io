It removes the need to run a virtual machine or restart and select an OS during dualbooting.\nIn this post, we will see how easy it is to install WSL on Windows and get an Ubuntu distribution up and running.\nInstalling WSL Installing WSL can be done by running Powershell (as an administrator) and run the command\nwsl --install This will actually install Ubuntu by default. To change this, we could use the command\nwsl --install -d \u0026lt;Distribution Name\u0026gt; The list of available distributions can be seen with wsl --list --online (equivalent to wsl -l -o!).\nThere are two versions of WSL, and this will set WSL2 as the default. We can use the command wsl -l -v in powershell or Windows command prompt to check which version is currently being used. If we would like to switch, wsl --set-default-version \u0026lt;1/2\u0026gt; will do the trick.\nSetting up Linux Running the Ubuntu app will open a window which will prompt us to enter an username and password. This will become the default user whenever Ubuntu is launched.\nOne nifty trick is to link the Windows home folder to Linux\u0026rsquo;s home folder via a symbolic link ln -s /mnt/c/Users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; ~/winhome. This will make the access to the Windows files easy via the command cd ~/winhome.\nPackages can be updated and upgraded as usual via sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade.\nSetting up Windows Terminal Windows Terminal is a great app to access and customize applications which have a command line interface. The Terminal can be downloaded directly from the Microsoft Store.\nResources  WSL documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/ Link to Windows files: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/658031/how-do-i-make-a-shortcut-to-a-path-using-two-tilde-characters-or-similar  ","permalink":"https://pwuethri.github.io/posts/220517_installing_wsl/","summary":"Introduction Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) is an amazing feature that allows users to run full Linux distros directly from Windows.
