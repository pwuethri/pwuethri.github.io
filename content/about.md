Welcome to my personal blog, my name is Pierre WÃ¼thrich.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist passionate about topics ranging from AI to Quantum Computing.

This webpage hosted on GitHub is my personal notes repository where I will occasionally make posts with interesting tidbits of coding/consulting I learned on my professional journey.
