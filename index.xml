      <description>Introduction I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself using the Caps lock key that much and would rather have it mapped to Control for convienience. While this is really straight-forward on a Mac, it requires a non-obvious solution on Windows. Luckily, SO came to the rescue.
The Recipe We need to run Powershell as an administrator and type the following commands:
$hexified = &amp;#34;00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00&amp;#34;.Split(&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;) | % { &amp;#34;0x$_&amp;#34;}; $kbLayout = &amp;#39;HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout&amp;#39;; New-ItemProperty -Path $kbLayout -Name &amp;#34;Scancode Map&amp;#34; -PropertyType Binary -Value ([byte[]]$hexified); After reboot, the caps lock key will be mapped to Ctrl</description>

In this post, we will see how easy it is to install WSL on Windows and get an Ubuntu distribution up and running.

Introduction Current or aspiring Engineer/Scientist are very likely to end up in a situation where coding will be required. I coded nearly every day in my jobs so far and it is therefore worthwhile to spend some time on finding and configuring available tools to ensure a smooth and productive experience.
My goal for this series is to describe how to set up a functioning coding environment on MacOS (Linux distros will be very similar if not the same).</description>
